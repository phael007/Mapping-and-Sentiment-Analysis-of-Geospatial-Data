In this task I shall use the dataset, Total Greenhouse Gas Emission dataset obtained from the World Bank.

I use a Python-based visualisation tool (such as GeoPandas) to plot a set of choropleth maps representing the world

greenhouse gas emission for the years 2000 and 2010 respectively. In this Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), the following operations would be performed:

1. import Libraries
2. import the datasets using Python library 
3. data cleaning
4. geospatial operations and 
5. generate and ploting using Python tool GeoPandas to visualize the choropleths of the dataset
6. Analysis of Geospatial Dataset

All the functions, libraries and coding steps would be explained in a lucid manner
